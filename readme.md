# Peeling Olympics Data from Kaggle using MySQL

This project aims to enhance your SQL skills by working with real-world Olympics data sourced from Kaggle. The project is inspired by [TechTFQ's blog post](https://techtfq.com/blog/practice-writing-sql-queries-using-real-dataset), but the solutions are developed independently using Google search and ChatGPT, without directly referring to their solutions.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to practice and sharpen your SQL querying skills by working with the Olympics dataset. The dataset contains information about various aspects of Olympic events, including athletes, countries, sports, and results.

The project consists of a series of 20 questions that require you to write SQL queries to extract relevant information from the dataset. Each question focuses on a specific aspect of querying and helps you learn various SQL techniques.

## Getting Started

1. **Dataset**: Download the Olympics dataset from Kaggle using the provided link in the [TechTFQ's blog post](https://techtfq.com/blog/practice-writing-sql-queries-using-real-dataset).

2. **Setting Up MySQL**: Make sure you have MySQL installed and set up on your local machine. You can use tools like MySQL Workbench or command-line interface to interact with the database.

3. **Creating the Database**: Create a new database in MySQL and import the dataset into appropriate tables. Refer to MySQL documentation or online tutorials for guidance on creating databases and importing data.

## Project Structure

- **Questions**: The "questions" directory contains the list of 20 questions, each in its separate SQL file (e.g., `question1.sql`, `question2.sql`, and so on).

- **Solutions**: The "solutions" directory is where you can store your SQL query solutions to each question (e.g., `solution1.sql`, `solution2.sql`, and so on).

- **Results**: Store the query results in a separate folder, named "results". Each query should produce a result set, and you can save the results as CSV files or screenshots.

## Usage

1. **Challenge Yourself**: Open the questions one by one and attempt to write SQL queries to solve them. Use Google searches and ChatGPT to find the relevant MySQL syntax and techniques.

2. **Compare Solutions**: Once you've written your solution, you can compare it with TechTFQ's solutions (if they're provided) or with peers if you're working on this project collaboratively.

3. **Learn and Improve**: Focus on understanding the logic behind each query. If you encounter difficulties, try to understand where you went wrong and learn from your mistakes.

4. **Record Your Progress**: As you complete each question, record your solution and the corresponding result in the "solutions" and "results" directories.
